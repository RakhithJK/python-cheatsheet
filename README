Based on the python cheatsheet from
http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/python-cheat-sheet/

The text for each language LA is in cheatsheet-LA.rst2pdf
The style for each language is in cheatsheet-LA.style

To build the stylesheet for language LA run:
    
    make LA

The output should be in cheatsheet-LA.pdf

Requirements for best output:

* rst2pdf from SVN (rst2pdf.googlecode.com)
* wordaxe from SVN for kerning support (deco-cow.sf.net)
* reportlab 2.3 (Version 2.1 is too old!)
* True Type Droid fonts (www.droidfonts.org)
* PIL (python imaging library) for the backgrounds
